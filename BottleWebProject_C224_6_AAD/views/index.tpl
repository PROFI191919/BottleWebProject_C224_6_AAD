        <h2>Directed and Undirected Graphs</h2>
        <p>A graph is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of vertices and a set of edges connecting some pairs of vertices. Graphs are widely used in various fields, such as mathematics, computer science, and engineering, to model connections and interactions between objects.</p>
        <h3>Directed Graph</h3>
        <p>A directed graph (digraph) is a graph where each edge has a direction assigned to it. The edges of a directed graph are called arcs...</p>
        <h3>Undirected Graph</h3>
        <p>An undirected graph is a graph in which the edges have no direction...</p>
        <h2>Weighted Graphs</h2>
        <p>A weighted graph is a graph where each edge is assigned a numerical weight...</p>
        <h2>Bipartite Graphs</h2>
        <p>A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets...</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Understanding directed and undirected graphs, weighted graphs, and bipartite graphs plays an important role in graph theory and its applications...</p>
