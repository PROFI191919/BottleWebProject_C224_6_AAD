        <h2>Directed and Undirected Graphs</h2>
        <p>
            A graph is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of vertices and a set of edges
            connecting some pairs of vertices. Graphs are widely used in various fields, such as mathematics,
            computer science, and engineering, to model connections and interactions between objects.
        </p>
        <h3>Directed Graph</h3>
        <p>A directed graph (digraph) is a graph where each edge has a direction assigned to it. The edges of a directed graph are called arcs.</p>
        <h3>Undirected Graph</h3>
        <p>An undirected graph is a graph in which the edges have no direction.</p>
        <h2>Weighted Graphs</h2>
        <p>A weighted graph is a graph where each edge is assigned a numerical weight.</p>
        <h2>Bipartite Graphs</h2>
        <p>A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets.</p>
